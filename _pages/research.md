My research fits in the framework of social determinants of population health outcomes. The framework incorporates demographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, and race), SES (e.g., education and income), interpersonal relationships (e.g., family arrangements and social networks), community environments (e.g., rural-urban inequality, residential segregation, and the availability of healthcare resources), as well as societal contexts (e.g., social norms, laws, and policies). I study how these factors shape the health disparities at both the individual and ecological level.

I focus on a variety of health outcomes including pain and pain-related conditions, opioid crisis outcomes, and others such as self-rated health. 

## Pain and pain-related conditions

### How long can people live w/o pain?

### How does pain predict disability?

### How pain prevalence distributes geographically?

## Opioid crisis outcomes

### Opioid prescribing

### Opioid mortality

## Other measures of health
