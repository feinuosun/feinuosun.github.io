I apply the [Team-Based Learning (TBL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team-based_learning) approach in my teaching. I have three years of experiences in instructing a variety of undergraduate level courses such as *Introduction to Social Research* and *Introduction to Sociology*. Before that, I also co-instructed the course *Statistics for Sociologists* with a tenured professor.
