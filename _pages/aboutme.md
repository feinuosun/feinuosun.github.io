I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Global Aging and Community Intiative, Mount Saint Vincent University, Canada, working for the NIH-funded R01 project “The Demography of Chronic Pain” with Drs. Zachary Zimmer, Anna Zajacova, and Hanna Grol-Prokopczyk, and also one of the 2021-2022 fellow of the Consortium on Analytics for Data-Driven Decision-Making (CAnD3), Mcgill University, Montreal, Canada. I am on the 2022-2023 academic job market.

My research interests are in demography of health (with a particular focus on pain), rural-urban health disparities, migration, quantitative methods, and spatial analysis. My work addresses questions about the social and environmental determinants of health outcomes (e.g, pain) at both the individual and ecological level. Some of my research has appeared in Social Science & Medicine, Annals of Epidemiology, Population, Space and Place, Ethnicity & health, Chinese Sociological Review, and Demographic Research. 

I obtained my Ph.D.in Sociology at the University at Albany, State University of New York with a graduate certificate in Demography in 2021. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Transportation Engineering from Sountheast University, Nanjing, China in 2015 and a bachelor's degree in Administrative Management (Self Examination) from Nanjing University, China.
